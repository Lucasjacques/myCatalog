Plan how to do this showcase:
Abstraction level 1:
  	- Display the products provided by "data.json" in the screen with their respective info


--------------------------------------------------
TO DO

Objectives:
	- Say that the "reference" in the JSON was the one the user had previously selected, liked, etc
	
	- Display data on screen:
		- [DONE] image 	
		- [DONE] product name
		- [DONE] detailUrl
		- price
		- oldPrice
		- payment conditions

BUGS / COULDN'T FIX:
	- [CRITICAL] Encode a string to UTF-8 format 

Enhancements:
	- Slide effect
	- Separate data.json from the code


		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../css/styles.css"/>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
