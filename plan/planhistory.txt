Plan how to do this showcase:
Abstraction level 1:
  	- Display the products provided by "data.json" in the screen with their respective info


--------------------------------------------------
TO DO [ALL DONE]

Objectives:
	- [DONE] Say that the "reference" in the JSON was the one the user had previously selected, liked, etc
	
	- Display data on screen:
		- [DONE] image 	
		- [DONE] product name
		- [DONE] detailUrl
		- [DONE]price
		- [DONE]oldPrice
		- [DONE]payment conditions

BUGS / COULDN'T FIX:
	- [DONE][CRITICAL] Encode a string to UTF-8 format 

Enhancements:
	- [DONE]Slide effect
	- [WON'T FIX]Separate data.json from the code
